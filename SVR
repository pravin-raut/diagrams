    participant Data as "Data Collection"
    participant Preprocess as "Data Preprocessing"
    participant Kernel as "Kernel Selection"
    participant Hyperparam as "Hyperparameter Tuning"
    participant Train as "Training SVR"
    participant Validate as "Model Validation"
    participant Adjust as "Adjust Hyperparameters"
    participant Forecast as "Forecasting"

    Data ->> Preprocess: Passes raw data
    Preprocess ->> Kernel: Passes normalized/standardized data
    Kernel ->> Hyperparam: Suggest potential kernel (linear, polynomial, RBF, etc.)
    Hyperparam ->> Train: Set initial C, epsilon, gamma values
    Train ->> Validate: Evaluate model performance on validation set
    Validate ->> Adjust: Feedback on model performance
    Adjust ->> Train: Adjust hyperparameters based on validation feedback
    Train ->> Forecast: Use trained model for forecasting
    Note over Data, Forecast: Repeat until optimal hyperparameters are found
